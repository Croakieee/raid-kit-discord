Discord Raidkit is an open-source, forever free tool that allows you to raid and destroy Discord servers via Discord bots, compromise Discord accounts, and generate Discord token grabbers.

[Have a feature suggestion? Make one here!](https://github.com/the-cult-of-integral/discord-raidkit/discussions/categories/ideas)

![Discord Raidkit v2.4.4 Console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98130822/235321378-f624a5ba-5ff6-4f80-b37e-8a1691724c53.png)

## Tools

- **Anubis** is a Discord bot with [nine malicious commands](#malicious-bot-commands). However, unlike other nuking tools, Anubis also has several non-malicious slash commands, including a moderation suite, to help you convince server administration to add the bot.

- **Qetesh** is a Discord bot with [nine malicious commands](#malicious-bot-commands). However, Qetesh also has 25 NSFW slash commands for the most popular pornographic kinks, at least according to PornHub. These commands should help take advantage of the degeneracy of Discord users.

- **Osiris** is the account manager of Discord Raidkit. Using Osiris, you can save the information of an account, login to an account using either Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge, or you can fully nuke an account, deleting channels, guilds, friends, and connections, deauthorizing applications, removing hype squad, and PATCHing various account settings. You can also generate Discord token grabbers within Windows Registry support. As of v2.4.2, Osiris has beta support for proxies.
 
 
## Installation

1. Head over to [the latest release].
2. Download the EXE zip.
3. Extract and run the executable in its directory.

**Notice:** Some anti-malware may flag this project as harmful ‚Äî especially any files that relate to Osiris, as this tool generates token stealers. If you are having issues with anti-malware constantly getting in the way of using this tool, you can create a folder, add that folder to the anti-malwares list of excluded search/scan locations, then place the Discord Raidkit files in said folder. This should allow Discord Raidkit to function correctly without interferance. **Do not randomly exclude every location on your computer!**

## v3.0.0 - November Preview

For those of you keeping up, you will be aware that I was working on converting this application to React.JS front-end. At the time, I was working with create-react-app, and the intention would be for the user to download the files, install node.js and run it locally. However, it quickly came to me that this idea was stupid. So, I then looked at using Electron with React.JS to distribute a desktop application, with a React.JS front-end. However, I'm not sure you would all appreciate a 250MB executable for a program that was previously 24KB.

So, I am now at plan three: a Tauri desktop application with a React.JS front-end. Now, the advantage of this is that the executable size shouldn't be ludicrous, and you'll all get prettier graphics that aren't a confusing terminal from the 90s. The disadvantage is that the backend is in Rust, and I've never used Rust. So, I suppose this will be an oppertunity for me to learn Rust. In the meantime, here's a screenshot of recent development. As you can see, as well as being a Desktop application now, there is also a dark mode! :)

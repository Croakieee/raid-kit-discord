## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities as issues, describing them in detail, including steps on how to reproduce. A security patch will come in the next version if the vulnerability is deemed serious enough to warrant patching. 

Remember, this is an application intended to be used by a single user, so security is not going to be too big of an issue. It is much more likely that security risks will come from Discord, rather than this application.
